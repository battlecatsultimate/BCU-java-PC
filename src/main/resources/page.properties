tip0=If you lose a battle, you can use a continue by pressing 4! Will not work if it's a No Continues stage, though...
tip1=Running low on Memory space? If your PC is 64-bit, try installing the 64-Bit version of Java.<br>If not, the BCU Discord server has this handy tool called run.bat to help out.
tip2=Don't push the devs to do whatever you feel like suggesting.<br>Developers are humans who made this software out of their own will, not robots.
tip3=Want to turn off those boxes below your units?Go to config page and turn off show axis! Though here's a fun fact:<br>Those boxes are actually each unit's hitbox and attack hitbox.
tip4=Don't give up just because your creations aren't good enough.<br>Everyone started being bad at all of this at some point.
tip5=It's okay to cry. It's okay to run away. You were not made that strong.
tip6=No more BCU until you do your homework!
tip7=Want to learn how to animate in BCU? Try copying some of the existing unit/enemy<br>animations and see how they work! Or try making a simple anim and fiddling with<br>the values.
tip8=A little briefing on easings: 0 is linear movement, 1 is instant movement (great for Frame-By-Frame components),<br>2 is exponential and is affected by parameter, 3 is polynomial, and 4 is sinusoidal.
tip9=Time in BCU is measured in frames. 30 frames = 1 second.
tip10=This program is completely free to use and open-source. If you paid for this, you got scammed.
tip11=Don't know what a button does? Hover your mouse over it to get a tooltip explaining what it does!<br>This is still WIP, so not all buttons have tooltips currently.
tip12=By changing the language of BCU and modifying text fields on a pack, you can have your pack<br>support multiple languages.
